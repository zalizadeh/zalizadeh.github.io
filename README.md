## AboutÂ Me

Iâ€™m **ZeinabÂ Alizadeh**, a Ph.D. candidate in convexâ€¯& stochastic optimization and variational
inequalities at the University of Arizona.  
My research tackles realâ€‘world problems in game theory and machine learning by developing
provably convergent algorithms that stay practical at scale.

I enjoy collaborating on challenging problems, whether in academia or industry,
and Iâ€™m always keen to translate rigorous math into impactful solutions.
